Melanoma_Detection_Assignment

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


Technologies Used

1.Jupyter Notebook
2.Python 3.0
3.Pandas 2.0.3
4.Seaborn 0.13.1
5.Matplotlib 3.7.1
6.TensorFlow

Conclusions

1.Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library
2.Model is still overfitting
3.The problem of overfitting can be solved by add more layer,neurons or adding dropout layers.
4.The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameter
